# Kid-Friendly Meal Plan Design 

## Task

Design a MON–SUN family‑dinner plan (`<NUMBER OF ADULTS>` adults, kids `<KIDS AGES>`) plus a one‑time Sunday meal‑prep session.

## Meal Prep Optimization

- Sunday prep session: 2-4 hours total (specify actual time needed)
- Maximize prep: Identify and execute every possible advance preparation that reduces weeknight active time
- For each dinner, prep everything safely possible in advance (to reduce weeknight active time to 20 min per dinner):
    * Pre-cut/season proteins and store properly
    * Make all sauces, dressings, and seasoning blends
    * Grate/shred all cheeses and portion toppings
    * Fully assemble dishes when food-safe (sheet pans, pizzas, etc.)
- Include detailed storage instructions for each prepped component

## Constraints

### Proteins & Frequency

- 1× fish night (MON)

- 2× chicken nights

- 2× vegetarian nights

- 1× red‑meat / ground turkey / pork / sausage night

- 1× eat‑out night on Saturdays

### Exclude Meals

- `<LIST MEALS YOUR FAMILY DOESN'T LIKE>`

### Cooking Cadence

- Exactly **4 Active‑Cook** dinners this week (includes any slow‑cooker night and Pizza Night).

- Of the 4 Active‑Cook dinners, ≥1 must be a slow‑cooker dinner.

- At least **2 Assemble/Reheat** dinners (≤10 min active): use planned leftovers; **label the source dish(es)**.

- Leftover spacing: Schedule Assemble/Reheat dinners at least 2 days after their source Active‑Cook dinner to avoid repetitive back‑to‑back meals.

- Don't use pizza as re-used dish.

- Respect freshness windows: use fish as **Active‑Cook on MON**; do not schedule fish leftovers as a later dinner (next‑day lunch only is OK).

- For beans, always use dry (where possible), prep them in Sunday meal prep in pressure cooker (no pre-soaking).

## Dietary Style & Themes

- "Division Of Responsibility" feeding approach

- Themed nights: **Curry, Pizza, Pasta, Sheet‑Pan, Mexican** (pick & assign).

- Use any appliances (pressure cooker, air fryer, rice cooker, oven, slow cooker etc.).

- Pizza Night specifics: Use a baking/pizza steel (preheat at oven's highest temp for ≥45–60 min; rack upper‑middle; finish under broiler if appropriate). **Use a frozen store‑bought crust (refined flour).** Do not suggest flatbread/tortilla/pre‑baked crust alternatives.

### Kid‑Friendly Foods

- Suggested veggies (optional): cherry tomatoes, bell pepper, carrot, broccoli, cauliflower, sugar‑snap peas, green peas, asparagus, green beans.

- Kid‑palate guardrails: keep flavors mild by default, offer sauces on the side, allow deconstructed plating when helpful, and suggest 1–2 topping options tailored for kids.

- When creating mixed dishes, include at least one "safe" component that kids reliably eat (e.g., plain pasta alongside sauced pasta, bread with stew, crackers)

- For any new or complex mixed dish, provide a deconstructed serving option. Not necessary for basic soups, stews, or curries.

### Nutrition & Health

- Prioritize whole grains; refined‑grain dinners must be **exactly 1 (Pizza Night)** due to the required refined‑flour store‑bought crust.

- Choose lean proteins and keep foods high in saturated fat or added sugar minimal.

- Each dinner must include a **Protein Anchor** (≥10 g protein per portion from meat, fish, eggs, tofu, legumes; **cheese alone doesn't count**).

- Across the week, ensure adequate calcium sources (dairy, yogurt, fortified plant milks, leafy greens) and iron sources (lean red meat, legumes, iron‑fortified foods); pair plant iron with vitamin‑C‑rich foods.

- Include high‑fiber components (whole grains, legumes, fruits, veggies) to ease kids' digestion.

- Aim for ≥5 distinct vegetables across the week; note repeats for re‑use but keep color variety.

- Omega‑3 coverage: default is **one oily‑fish dinner** (salmon, trout, sardines, mackerel, herring). If using a **lean white fish** instead (cod/tilapia), include **≥2 boosters** that day (e.g., ground flax/chia, walnuts, DHA‑fortified milk/yogurt/eggs, or using canola/rapeseed or soybean oil) and label them.

### Complexity Caps

- ≤ **10 ingredients per dinner** (exclude staples: salt, pepper, oil, butter, soy sauce, vinegar, lemon/lime, garlic, onion, basic dried spices).

- **No more than 5 new ingredients** introduced by any single dinner that are not reused elsewhere in the week.

## Leftovers & Lunches

- Provide adult lunches via doubled dinners or build‑your‑own lunch boxes.

- Lunch items must pack in <5 min next morning.

### Ingredient Re‑Use & Freshness

- Groceries are bought SUN; **sequence meals** so **MON=fish**, **TUE–WED=poultry or meat**, **later days=vegetarian/less‑perishable**.

- **Plan deliberate overlap of ingredients** typically bought in larger packages or bunches—e.g., roast chicken and use leftovers mid‑week; split one bunch of cilantro between curry and tacos; use one clamshell of baby spinach in two dishes—so nothing goes to waste.

- **Adjust ingredient quantities to account for planned re‑use:** When cooking for leftovers, increase quantities appropriately (e.g., 1.5x or 2x base recipe amounts). When using ingredient overlaps, specify exact amounts needed for each dish.

- Keep a small jar of **ground flax or chia** and **walnuts** in play at least twice this week so omega‑3 boosters are easy to use up.

- Prefer **canola/rapeseed oil** as the default cooking fat this week unless otherwise specified.

- Only prep on Sunday items that will be used within their safe storage window before spoiling or losing quality. For any ingredients needed later in the week (beyond their safe storage time), schedule their prep for a later day (specify which day and what prep to do then). For example:

## Output rules

- Output only the final plan + the Compliance Check table.

- Use the per‑night template below for each day.

- Use the "Assemble/Reheat Nights — Required Format" where applicable.

### Per-night template

DAY – Dish name & theme — Active‑Cook | Assemble/Reheat | Eat‑Out

Protein anchor:

Fiber components:

Calcium source(s):

Iron + Vitamin‑C pairing:

Ingredients (≤10, exclude staples):

Steps (≤3, ≤40 min active on weeknights):

Leftovers → next‑day lunches: (Y/N; what and how many)

Kid options: (1–2)

Omega‑3 note (if applicable):


### Assemble/reheat nights template

- For every **Assemble/Reheat** night, provide this exact structure:

- **Source dish(es):**

- **Reused items:** (protein/grain/sauce/veg)

- **Plate in ≤10 min:** (≤3 bullets; no cooking beyond reheating/toasting)

- **Kid options:** (1–2 toppings or sides)


### Sunday meal-prep template

- Table with columns: **Dish / Ingredient / Week day**, **Exact Prep**, **Storage & Label**.

- **Exact Prep**: metric + imperial amounts from grocery list, precise cut/shape (note differences if reused in multiple dishes), and batch prep instructions.

- **Storage & Label**: method (airtight, freezer, on ice, wrapped in paper towel etc.)

- Quantities must match grocery list, account for all dinners + planned leftovers, and reflect scaled batch sizes where needed.

- Combine washing/peeling for efficiency but store separately if cut/shape or dish differs.
