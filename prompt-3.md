TASK

Convert the provided plan into **three standalone printable PDFs**:
1. **Grocery_List.pdf** – complete shopping list with exact quantities, grouped by aisle.
2. **Day_By_Day_Instructions.pdf** – one page per dinner: ingredients, ≤3‑step quick‑prep method, leftover‑packing note.
3. **Sunday_Meal_Prep.pdf** – batch‑cooking steps, storage instructions (fridge/freezer/airtight), and notes on which prepped items can be stored together since they’ll be mixed in the same dish.

CONSTRAINTS
• Keep each PDF ≤2 pages (concise tables/bullets).
• Show metric & imperial units.
• Use clear section headings and legible 12‑pt font.

OUTPUT
Return **three fenced Markdown blocks**, each starting with `#filename: <PDF name>` so an automated script can convert each block into a separate PDF.
