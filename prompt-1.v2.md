# ⭐️ MASTER MEAL-PLAN GENERATOR PROMPT

## PART 0 — Recipe Source
- Use **only the recipes I provide**.
- If I have not provided recipes, ask:
  **“Would you like me to generate recipes or will you provide them?”**
- You may add simple sides (whole grains, steamed vegetables), but no invented composed dishes.

---

## PART 1 — Goal
Generate:
1. A **Monday–Sunday dinner plan** for **6 servings per night** (Adults: <NUMBER OF ADULTS> + Kids: <KIDS AGES>).
2. A **maximal Sunday meal-prep plan** that moves as much work as safely possible to Sunday.  
3. **Fully expanded, standalone instructions** for every dinner night — enough to cook without referencing the original recipes.  
4. A **comprehensive grocery list**.  
5. A **compliance check** verifying all constraints.

---

## PART 2 — Protein Rules
- Monday = **fish** (white fish only; salmon excluded).  
- 2 chicken dinners.  
- 2 vegetarian dinners.  
- 1 red-meat / pork / turkey dinner.  
- **At least one slow-cooker dinner** (any night except Monday).  
- Saturday = eat-out.

---

## PART 3 — Excluded Meals (MUST NEVER APPEAR)
- Excluded meals, ingredients, or dishes must **not** be included in the plan.  
- For this family: <EXCLUDED MEALS>
- If a recipe contains an excluded ingredient or resembles an excluded dish, choose a different recipe that satisfies the same constraints.

---

## PART 4 — Cooking Cadence
- Sunday meal prep must be **maximized** and follow this exact order:
  1. **Cook all grains/pasta/simple sides first**  
  2. **Chop all vegetables second**  
  3. **Cook all proteins and complex dishes third**  
- Weeknight dinner requirements:
  - Monday = Active-Cook  
  - Tue–Fri = **5–10 minute reheat/assembly**  
  - Sunday dinner = Assemble  
- Leftover rules:
  - Leftovers reused only after **≥2 days**  
  - Fish leftovers → **never used for dinners**  
  - At least **2** Assemble/Reheat nights  
- For Assemble/Reheat nights, explicitly list:
  - Source dish(es)  
  - Reused components (protein, grain, vegetables, sauce)

---

## PART 5 — Nutrition & Kid-Friendliness
Each dinner must include:
- Protein anchor (≥10 g per serving)  
- Fiber component  
- Calcium source  
- Iron + Vitamin-C pairing (≥2 nights/week)  
- Mild base flavors; sauces on the side  
- At least one “safe food” for each child  
- Deconstructed plating option where useful  
- Whole grains preferred  
- **If Monday uses white fish, include ≥2 omega-3 boosters** (e.g., flax, chia, walnuts, DHA-fortified foods)

---

## PART 6 — Freshness & Storage Strategy
- All groceries purchased Sunday.  
- Perishability sequencing:
  - Mon fish  
  - Tue–Wed poultry/meat  
  - Thu–Fri–Sun vegetarian  
- All Sunday-prepped foods must remain safe for 3–4 days.  
- Encourage reuse of herbs, greens, grains, cheeses.  
- Use multipliers (1.5× or 2×) for adequate leftovers.  
- Include **next-day lunch leftovers** where appropriate (≤5 minutes to prepare; no fish).

---

## PART 7 — Complexity Caps
- ≤10 ingredients per dinner (excluding staples).  
- ≤5 new ingredients per dinner.  
- Weeknight methods must be short and efficient.

---

## PART 8 — Weekly Dinner Plan (Mon–Sun)
For each night include:
- Dish name  
- Classification: Active-Cook / Reheat / Assemble / Slow-Cook  
- Fully expanded instructions (complete steps, no external recipe lookup)  
- Exact ingredient quantities (metric + imperial)  
- ≤3 steps for reheats; full steps for Monday  
- Leftover routing (what is reserved and for which day)  
- Kid options  
- Omega-3 check on Monday  
- Iron + Vitamin-C check  
- Confirmation that no excluded meals appear  
- Fish leftovers not reused for dinners

---

## PART 9 — Grocery List (Sorted by Aisle)
Each entry includes:
- Ingredient name  
- Total amount (metric + imperial)  
- Aisle  
- Used in (list nights)  

Must match:
- Dinner plan amounts  
- Sunday prep amounts  
- Leftover routing  
- Excluded-meals rules

---

## PART 10 — Sunday Meal Prep (Detailed)
Produce a structured plan with these sections:

### **A. Cook First (Grains & Simple Sides)**
- All grains, pasta, rice, couscous  
- Broccoli wash/chop  
- Tortilla portioning  

### **B. Chop Second (Vegetables)**
- Peppers, onions, garlic, sweet potatoes, greens, herbs, citrus  
- All vegetables used during the week  

### **C. Cook Third (Proteins & Complex Dishes)**
- All chicken batches  
- Meatballs + sauce  
- Full vegetarian stew or other long-cook dishes  
- Slow-cooker dishes (prep, load, cook schedule)  
- Any sautéed/roasted vegetable components  

### **D. Storage Table**
For each prepared component specify:
- Container type  
- Storage duration  
- Whether stored separately or together  
- Labeling instructions  

### **E. Items Safe to Store Together**
List flavor-, texture-, and moisture-compatible combinations.
